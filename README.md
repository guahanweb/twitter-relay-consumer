# Twitter Relay Consumer

> :warning: **Workshop specific project!** if you are not attending
> the [All Things Open](https://www.allthingsopen.org) workshop titled
> *Telling Stories with Big Data*, you are likely in the wrong place!

## Overview

This project contains all the necessary code and configuration to
run the workshop and follow along locally during the ATO session.
By running this application stack, you will be able to register as
a consumer of an established Twitter Stream. Since Twitter restricts
the active connections to a single stream, this project will connect
to a relay service via web socket and allow all participants to
monitor the stream in real time.

> :info: **Prerequisite:** this push-button solution requires use
> of `docker-compose`, so having [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
> installed is required.

Once you have Docker running, follow the setup steps below.

## Push-button setup

If you have Docker installed and running, configuration and execution
are very straightforward.

### Clone the repo


### Create a `.docker.env` file


### Spin up the stack
